Comments:

Added a few displaying options
l - light source fixed to a camera
b - shows a bounding box
a - shows the axis
n - shows the normals
f - uses flat shading (default is smooth)
debug - prints debug statements, for development purposes

The program can run with these as arguments or they can be typed at run time
to alternate the option on or off.
i.e., 
viewer [.obj file] -b -a
will run the viewer showing both a bounding box and the axis.
Note that the arguments must be separate and mush have the '-' flag in front

Pressing 'b' at during runtime will hide the bounding box.
Pressing 'b' again will show it again.
