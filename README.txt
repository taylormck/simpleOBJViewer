Comments:

Added a few displaying options
b - shows a bounding box
a - shows the axis
n - shows the normals

The program can run with these as arguments or they can be typed at run time.
i.e., 
viewer [.obj file] -b -a
will run the viewer showing both a bounding box and the axis.
Note that the arguments must be separate and mush have the '-' flag in front

Pressing 'b' at during runtime will hide the bounding box.
Pressing 'b' again will show it again.
